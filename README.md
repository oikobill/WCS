# WCS
This is a project develop for one of my cognitive psychology classes. For that task, we collected images using Google Maps and then 
fed those in t Python. We did some image processing and tried to test the hypothesis below regarding the impact of the immediate environment 
on the formation of languages.
Hypothesis testing: Color naming patterns of different languages depend on  the distribution of colors in the immediate environment where the language was developed.
